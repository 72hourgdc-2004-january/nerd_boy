    Programmed and Compiled Using Microsoft Visual C++ .NET Standard Edition

    Language used is C++ and a wee bit of _asm

    Library used was DirectX 9.0

    Artwork done with Paint,Paint Shop Pro,Dogwaffle, and Gimp

    Music: There is no music or sound effects. The titanium walls prevent sound
    		waves from entering. Sorry.

    Source Code is in main.cpp.

    Requirements:
    A computer :)
    DirectX 9.0
    Keyboard
    Monitor and graphics card capable of 640x480x16
    Not sure what windows platform, but made on XP, but was also tested on 98, successfully

    Controls:
    Esc - When in intro or game, will lead to menu. When in menu, will exit game.
    Space - When in Menu, will start the game.
    Mouse - Moves ship left and right.
    Left Click - Fire antacid. (Note: There is a reloading period where neither of the launchers work.
    				     This is because the launcher is constructing another antacide tablet
    				     from stomach acid and various food particles. Also, the launchers
    				     alternate. So watch out!)

    Point of game:
    You are inside a stomach.  Sadly, the person(whose gender shall remain a mystery) eats a bunch
    of junk FOOD.  You must use your "Stomach"-ship's antacid missiles to takeout the food. When 100
    items of FOOD get past you, you are destroyed in the resulting heartburn.

    Cheat Codes:
    The cheatcode is "nb", short for nerd_boy. Just press "n" and "b" in the
    middle of the game, and all of the food on the screen will dissappear. BUT, there
    is a catch. It divides your score by 2 and you can only use it once.
